      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Context</h1>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">About the Program</h2>
      <p class="">
        Over the past year, Zoom has played an integral role in everyday communications at Duke and across the globe.
        Utilizing mobile technology and the Zoom Developer Platform, we worked with Duke OIT and other partners across
        campus to develop a web app to evolve Zoom’s presence and capabilities within higher education.
      </p>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-center text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        There are currently 40,000 licensed users at Duke who, during the month of April, held between 8,000 and 10,000
        meetings a day.
      </div>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">About the Scope</h2>
      <p class="">
        We were tasked with developing an educational app that further enhances the collaborative efforts between
        instructors and students, as well as opening the door to new resources supporting education. With almost a full
        year of hindsight available, we can begin to fill in the gaps of where Zoom can be improved to meet Duke’s needs
        of providing a hybrid/remote teaching and learning experience that rivals that of an in-person offering.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Our Stakeholders:</h2>
      <p class="">
        For our project, we regularly communicated with our three stakeholders:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Jeremy Petranka</span>, the Assistant Dean of the Master of Quantitative
          Management (MQM) and Master of Management Studies (MMS) programs at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Research</h1>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Understanding the Scope</h1>
        <p class="">
          At the start of our project, our initial guidance was to create a web app that could improve the capabilities
          of Zoom for education. Within our team, we brainstormed potential avenues that we could explore. We also met
          with
          our stakeholders to evaluate what they deem to be the potential areas of improvement. </p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="img/Brainstormed-pain-points.png" alt="Brainstormed Pain Points" class="w-3/4 mx-auto">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center">Some of the ideas we were considering as we thought about common
            pain points
            users have experienced with Zoom.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          After receiving this
          information, we narrowed down our ideas to only the most relevant and sorted them based on feasibility. From
          this, we were able to identify our problem for the summer:
        </p>
        <div class="p-4 m-4 text-lg text-center rounded-md bg-gray-100">
          It's difficult to navigate through and find the right Zoom recording.
        </div>
        <ul class="lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">1. Lack of context</span>: <br>Recordings are only titled by the
            meeting name and
            date.
            When using a recurring meeting, all recordings will have the same title
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">2. Lack of organization</span>: <br>It's difficult to arrange
            zoom recordings and

          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">3. Lack of search features</span>: <br>Most of the time, the
            fastest way to find the

            error.

        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Users and Audience</h1>
          <p class="">
            We identified six types of users that could potentially benefit from an educational recording management
            tool.
          </p>
          <ul class="grid grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

          <p>For our project, we decided to tailor our app to Student 1 <span class="font-semibold">(Nina)</span> and
            Student 2 <span class="font-semibold">(Owen)</span>.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-center text-gray-600">Nina is an undergraduate student majoring in Neuroscience who

          <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">User Surveys</h1>
            <p class="">
              To validate our scope and understand potential solutions, we conducted a survey of the Duke undergraduate
              student body and received 19 responses. Our hypotheses were that:
            </p>
            <ul class="">
              <li>
                A) Students find watching course
                recordings useful
              </li>
              <li>
                B) Students watch course recordings to study, not just as a way to skip live sessions
              </li>
              <li>
                C) Students felt that the current way of sorting through recordings is time-consuming and difficult
              </li>
            </ul>


            <p>
              At a high-level, we saw that students were accustomed to watching recordings from their Zoom lectures for
              a variety of purposes, including studying and making up missed lectures.
              <br><br>
            <div class="lg:grid lg:grid-flow-col">

              <img>
            </div>
            We also asked questions to gauge what would be better for students and how willing they would be to
            contribute to a solution.
            </p>
            <br class="hidden lg:block"><br>
            <div class="lg:grid lg:grid-flow-col">
              <img src="img/Survey-Zoom-easiertofind.png"
                alt="Survey results showing 68.4% of participants strongly agreed that recordings would be easier to find if titled">

              <img>
            </div>
            <p>These results were somewhat surprising! While Duke currently has tools in place like Piazza that allow
              students to collaborate and ask questions for each other and professors, we were unsure of how willing
              they would be to add their own thoughts to lecture content. This result opened up possibilities for our
              future functionalities as we found that students would be more likely to find the recording they are
              looking for if they have some identifying feature. </p>

    </div>

    <!--Solution-->
    <div class="space-y-4 py-6 lg:py-10">
      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Solution</h1>
      <p>We thought of some “How might we” questions and collaborated with our project leads to brainstorm solutions:
      </p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">How might we</span> help students understand their course material better with
          limited time?
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">How might we</span> help instructors organize their content in one place?
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold ">How might we</span> create a classification system of recordings with low
          effort?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also explored the current solutions in place, like the Zoom integration through the Sakai LMS and Panopto
        which is a popular tool for managing videos, and indirect competitors like Piazza and Gong. What we saw was
        there were common elements that made posts/videos stand out:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Title (which currently is just the Zoom meeting ID)
        </li>
        <li>
          Date
        </li>
        <li>
          Keywords (from Piazza, which allows you to tag posts into categories)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Through collaborative sessions, we decided on our question to be: <span class="font-semibold">How might we
          create a web-app that allows
          students and instructors to easily categorize and navigate to previous
          recordings?</span>
      </p>
      <p>Out of this question, we came up with Review.</p>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-center text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        ReView is a web app that uses video transcripts to summarize class recordings and tag key topics to make
        studying for tests and understanding material covered in each lecture easier with minimal effort by the
        professor. ReView not only functions as a study tool, but as a way to help professors organize recording
        content, make class materials more accessible, and create a way to increase engagement with course content.
      </div>
      <p>By applying natural language processing on Zoom video transcripts we can autogenerate summaries and keywords.
        Our web-app can then act
        as a crowdsourcing platform to have students, the users, to update content, add their own notes, and watch
        videos - all in the same place.</p>
    </div>

    <!--Design Process-->
    <div class="space-y-4 py-6 lg:py-10">
      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Design Process</h1>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Wireframes</h2>
      <p>First, I sketched out the necessary components.</p>
      <img src="img/Wireframes-Review.png" alt="Wireframes" class="mx-auto">
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Mockups</h2>
      <p>After critiquing the wireframes as a group, we started generating lo-fi mockups to better visualize our app.
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-2 py-4">
        <img class="h-96 w-auto mx-auto" src="img/Example Site 1.png" alt="Review Lo-fi mockups">

      </div>
      <p>
        With more feedback, we solidified our base design and moved on to hi-fi mockups to better represent our designs.
      </p>

      <img src="img/Group 33.png" alt="Review Hi-fi mockups">
      <img src="img/Group 34.png" alt="Review Hi-fi mockups">

      <p>As we were inputting and testing data with our prototype, we found that the table was getting a bit long. We
        decided to add a second view, a card view, that’s common in similar services like Panopto or Notion. We also
        experimented with different styles to better align with Duke's style guide.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/CardView-Review.jpg" alt="Mockup of Card View for Review" class="h-1/2 w-3/4 mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Stakeholder Feedback</h2>
      <p>From the faculty point of view, they’d like to see what students are doing on their site. For us to understand
        that, we had to be able to implement roles - identification of the user into either a student or faculty. This
        insight adapted both the infrastructure and design of our app. </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">User Testing</h2>
      <p>Using real-life data from youtube transcripts from a math class one of our team members took in the spring
        semester. We interviewed 11 students, asking them to give us their impressions of the app and complete a few
        tasks. Some tasks included:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Find the title of a lecture that occurred on a specific date.
        </li>
        <li>
          Indicate that a specific keyword is relevant to a lecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add your own thoughts from the lecture to the recording page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The results were surprising! Users were able to identify issues in flow (like the navigation not having a home
        button) that we were unsure of, and supported design decisions like having a list view and a card view.
        We also found that 45% of users would be more likely to edit a section called “Notes” than “Summary” because a
        summary is supposed to be a concise 1 or 2 sentence statement.
      </p>
      <p>Students also noted that they were unsure how to differentiate between autogenerated content and teacher
        approved content, which gave us more to think about. We took all the suggestions that came out of the user
        testing and ranked them according to priority (which was determined partly by how many users ran into the same
        problem) and feasibility (how much effort it would take to implement the feature). We then systematically
        addressed this feedback for the remaining time of our project.</p>

      <p>
        As my first team project, I learned a tremendous amount from Code+. First and foremost, I learned a lot about
        cooperation with team members, which was an interesting challenge participating in this program through a hybrid
        environment (2 of our team members were on campus and the rest of us were remote). I also gained valuable
        experience pacing our workload against a deadline.
        <br><br>
        Because this was one of the first projects I’ve had to scope out myself, I saw firsthand the importance of
        prioritization. There were so many interesting and ambitious ideas that we all had, especially with a product
        like Zoom that we’ve all become so accustomed to using, so it was definitely a challenge deciding which to
        tackle first.
        <br><br>
        Despite our program only lasting 10 weeks, I felt as though we made incredible progress and learned so much. I’m
        so thankful for the opportunity to work with my talented team, and I look forward to seeing our project one day
        impact the Duke community!

      <p>For our app, we hope to respond to stakeholder and user feedback by implementing multi-platform support and
        advanced admin features. We hope to continue doing more user testing with longer 75-minute class data to
        evaluate the accuracy of our auto generated tags and summaries. We hope to update our web app and beta test it
        in classes during the fall and spring semester to evaluate if it can be used as an alternative to the current
        solution.</p>
