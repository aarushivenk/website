      <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl text-2xl font-semibold">Overview</h1>
      <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">Have you ever sat down one night for dinner and was not in any mood to cook? Or what
        about when you order Chipotle for the 10th time and ask yourself, is this all there is? Well, <span
          class="font-semibold">CHOMP</span> is the app for you. I participated in a UX/UI bootcamp led by the <a
          href="https://webservices.duke.edu/crux/" class="underline">Creative + User Experience Team</a> at Duke
        University where we were tasked with this prompt, and learned about content and design principles as we worked
        out a way to solve our common problem. Here's my own take on the bootcamp's prompt.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl text-2xl font-semibold">The Problem</h1>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">After a year of the pandemic, we're all tired of cooking. We
        need to find a way to provide more dining options and promote local restaurants.</p>
      <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">Our first step as a group was to understand what our stakeholders envisioned for this
        product. We came up with key questions to include in our interview, some of which are below:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc md:mx-24">
        <li>How do you currently go about choosing where to eat?</li>
        <li>What do you like and disliked about food delivery apps you currently use?</li>
        <li>What information would you like to have when choosing where to go?</li>
        <li>For this mobile app, how would you define success?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl text-2xl font-semibold">Content Analysis</h1>
      <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">After going through the answers from the stakeholder interview, we compiled words and
        phrases that stood out to us and sorted them into key categories.</p>
      <h2 class="font-semibold">Eating Habits</h2>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">"Typically, I guess the kids tell me what they want and I go
        and get what they want. But, when I’m by myself, it’s mostly whether or not I feel like soup or like fries. So,
        I let my stomach decide. But, I wish I was more adventurous because I only go to the same places. I go to
        McDonald’s or Panera bread and that’s it."</p>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">"I have my partner, so I have to take into consideration
        someone else’s opinions. But, I think we probably have about 10 places that we rotate through take-out from."
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-semibold">Finding Food</h2>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">"There are a lot of places I want to go that I see on
        Instagram."</p>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">"If I know it, I’ll go there. If I don’t know it, I’m not
        searching for it. "</p>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">"I use GrubHub because they have those bigger categories
        like Asian and they list the restaurants. And then I peruse the different restaurant menus."</p>
      <h2 class="font-semibold">Success Criteria</h2>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">"It turns me on to a new place because I feel like I’m
        pretty knowledgeable with my options of where to eat around here. So it would be nice - a delightful outcome - I
        find out about a new restaurant that I haven’t tried yet and it’s really good.
        "</p>
      <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg md:text-lg">" It will tell me where to eat and I will actually like the
        place it selects."</p>

      <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">To start our design, I sorted the features the stakeholders mentioned into categories
        that fit most appropriately. Then, I made wireframes to think about the best layouts for the app, and looked to
        Dribbble and Behance for inspiration.</p>

      <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">Sticking with the warm color palette we chose in the bootcamp, I chose the typography
        to give the app a more playful feel to match my proposed logo.</p>

      <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl text-2xl font-semibold">Reflection</h1>
      <p class="my-6 mb-36 md:text-lg">Participating in this bootcamp was an amazing experience. I am so thankful to have the experience to learn about the components of UX/UI design from talented individuals, as well as the opportunity to work with others interested in the same field.

        Working on <span class="font-semibold">CHOMP</span> in particular was a really fun experience. I spent a lot of time browsing sites such as Behance and Dribbble for inspiration, and this certainly challenged my conceptions of UI design. I found that the most useful part of the process was the content analysis. Sorting information into cards that group together common categories was very helpful for me to organize my own information. I found myself going back to this list and creating new ones, understanding what the flow of information should be and how to make it the easiest for the user. It is definitely going to be a practice I continue in future projects.</p>
