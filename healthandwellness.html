          <p class="md:text-lg">There are more than 318,000 health and wellness apps currently in the app store, with 200+ being added each day. Especially due to COVID, more and more of us have turned to the virtual world to guide us on our health journeys. Home gym and workout equipment has had skyrocketing sales as people aim to improve or create healthy habits at home. One popular and easy way of keeping healthy is by using a habit tracker app. 
            With many on the market, I wanted to look at 3 pedometer apps-Pacer, StepsApp, Pedometer++-and determine what draws user attention and retains users. A pedometer itself is a relatively simple concept, and on most iPhones, users already have a built-in health app that does just that. What I wanted to know was what additional features, interface, etc, gives an app the edge to attract users in.

        Audience</h1>
      <p class="md:text-lg">Based on the users’ responses, I was able to identify 3 different users, 1 for each app. Pedometer++ attracted more of an older, less tech-savvy audience. StepsApp seemed more towards those who wanted to track a little bit more than their steps and could use a little extra motivation. Pacer was for those who were more dedicated to fitness, specifically those who looked for the most out of their apps.
