      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Context</h1>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">About FTN Network</h2>
      <p class="">
        <a href="https://www.ftnfantasy.com/" class="text-blue-600 underline">FTN Network</a>is a company cofounded in
        2020 by Kevin Adams and Brad Evans, aiming to provide in-depth entertainment and analysis from industry-leading
        experts while developing unique user-friendly tools to help optimize user’s success on all fantasy platforms.
        The tool we worked on
        this summer is a part of their NFL tools section. I worked alongside a developer on three tools - the Splits
        tool, the Pace tool, and the Wide Receiver vs. Cornerback (WR vs. CB) tool - to add new search/filter features
        and simplify the user experience.
      </p>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-center text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        “FTN brings you the best tools in the industry to win your fantasy football championship.”
      </div>
      <p>It was such a transformative experience to be able to work on these tools throughout the summer. Our goal was
        to transform key stats into easy to understand and approachable numbers that could help anyone be at the top of
        their fantasy league. Throughout this project, I conducted competitor research to identify gaps and
        opportunities and iterated through the design process to create the
        tools that are currently live on the FTN sites (FTNFantasy.com, FTNdaily.com, and FTNbets.com). </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">About the Scope</h2>
      <p class="">
        We revisited one of the first tools we made for FTN Network - the Splits Tool - with new ideas ahead of the
        upcoming NFL season. The NFL Splits tool is available to FTN Network Premium members. Its aim is to help users
        understand how teams and players have performed in previous years. We performed a redesign primarily to improve
        the visual design and increase usability, especially for users who have less football proficiency.
        We aimed to improve the design by adhering to a proposed style guide that will make for a
        more consistent product. Adding more quality of life features will help acclimate first time users and enable
        power users to do more. A new visualization to reveal insightful patterns, the ability to share, and new table
        settings are just a few of
        the new ideas we wanted to bring. The Splits Tool v1 laid the foundation, v2 takes it to the next level.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4">Our Stakeholders:</h2>
      <p class="">
        For the duration of the summer, we closely worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/EliotCrist?s=20"
          class="text-blue-600 underline">Eliot
          Crist</a>, the COO/CTO of FTN Network.

    <div class="space-y-4 py-6 lg:py-10">

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Research</h1>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Setting our Scope</h2>
      <p class="">
        Our first step to begin this project was to do a deep dive on the current version of the Splits Tool and
        identify areas of improvement.</p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <img src="img/SplitsToolv1.png" alt="Brainstormed Pain Points" class="w-3/4 mx-auto">
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center">The Splits Tool v1 at first glance</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        We categorized all of the changes we hoped to make and prioritized them based on usability, time to
        complete,
        and reusability. The four sections we focused on were (1) New features, (2) Design - including usability,
        differentiators, and bells & whistles, and (4) Bug fixes.

      </p>

      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Users and Audience</h1>
        <p class="">
          We identified two types of users that we saw were most likely to be using this tool.
        </p>
        <ul class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold text-lg">Existing Users: Football Enthusiasts</span><br>
            They never miss a game and always review their stats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold text-lg">New Users: Casual watchers and Fantasy players</span><br>
            People with an interest in football and is in a fantasy league. They want to level up in an easy and
            low-cost way.

          </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <!--Solution-->
    <div class="space-y-4 py-6 lg:py-10">
      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Our Goal</h1>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-center text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        Redesign the split tool to allow for new users and existing users have a seamless user experience as they use
        this tool to help with their fantasy teams.
      </div>
      <p>Referring back to our original wireframes and mockups, we adjusted and presented our new idea that incorporates
        old elements and new ones as well.
      <div class="grid grid-cols-2">

          alt="First ever iteration of the Splits Tool">
      </div>


      <br> <br>
      New notable features introduced were (1) the ability to copy the url containing the split, which would make it
      easier for users to share the split with others, (2) a parallel coordinates visualization that allows users to
      look at the individual game data to identify patterns or abnormalities, and (3) introducing trending cards to
      highlight on one hand, interesting players/teams to watch, and on the other hand, sample uses of the tool.

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Design Process</h1>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2"></h2>
      <p>Based on our identified areas of improvement, we created new screens to present to our stakeholder.</p>

      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center">Initial Mockups shared with the FTN Team for the start of the
        redesign.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Component Library</h2>
      <p>After agreeing on the direction to take the redesign, we worked on the development of each individual component
        of the design.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-gray-100 py-4">
        <img src="img/TrendingCards.png" alt="Trending Cards Design" class=" w-3/4 mx-auto">

      </div>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center">Sample iterations of different components. </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">User Testing</h2>
      <p> As we started to put the components together and refine the combined project, we then moved on to usability
        testing. We asked 3 users to do an in-depth survey of our tool. Namely, we wanted to see if our changes helped
        first-time users understand how to navigate the
        different types of filters.
        We asked questions like:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Compare the Carolina Panthers TDs at home vs away.
        </li>
        <li>
          How do the Panthers do with Christian McCaffery vs. without?
        </li>
        <li>
          Compare Julio Jones 2019 performance with 2020.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We found major commonalities between the users. The number one request was for a hierarchy to help users
        understand what they should do first. Because of this, we revisted our designs and reworked how we displayed
        filters into a "stepper": a visual depiction of a process to guide users through creating a split.
        <br><br>
        I created two versions of this stepper, one being vertical which would adapt well across different device sizes,
        and horizontal, which helps draw the user's attention to the filter process from the beginning.
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-2 space-x-4">
        <img src="img/HL-Step2 (1).png" alt=" Horizontal Stepper">
        <img src="img/VL=Step2.png" alt="Vertical Stepper">
      </div>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center">The mockups for a horizontal stepper (left) and vertical stepper
        (right). </p>
      <p>We went back to our initial group of users and presented the new designs to them, in additional to the working
        model. We got positive feedback that the stepper helped make the tool more clear, and we worked to clean up the
        unclear language as well add instructions in relevant locations. Some users had preferences for the horizontal
        stepper, whereas others had a preference for the vertical stepper. Given the time constraints of our project, we
        chose to move forward with the vertical design to focus on responsivity first. </p>

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        Seeing this project from where it first started last year, with the first iteration of the splits tool, to now
        where it is now is very rewarding. Both from a visual standpoint and a utility standpoint, users and
        stakeholders agree that it is a significant level-up from the previous version.
        <br><br>
        This project really helped me break down assumptions. Working with a group of users who are extremely
        knowledgeable about the field of football, there was a lot for me to learn. Having those opportunities to hear
        from real-life/real-time users of the app was beneficial, as we were able to use their feedback to
        make major changes to the tool before its launch.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Next Steps</h2>
      <p>We're continuously releasing weekly updates to each tool, with a plan to continue iterating on our design
        throughout the 2021-2022 NFL season. As more data comes and as more users frequent the site, we hope to better
        understand how to help users find the information they need in the best way possible.</p>
