      <p><span class="font-bold text-red-400">BACKGROUND |</span> There are more than <span class="text-red-400">318,000
        </span>health and wellness apps currently in the app store, with <span class="text-red-400">200+ </span>being
        added each day. Especially due to COVID, more and more of us have turned to the virtual world to guide us on our
        health journeys. Home gym and workout equipment has had skyrocketing sales as people aim to improve or create
        healthy habits at home. One popular and easy way of keeping healthy is by using a habit tracker app.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5 font-bold text-2xl px-10 text-red-400">With many on the market, I wanted to look at 3 pedometer
        apps-Pacer, StepsApp, Pedometer++-and determine what draws user attention and retains users.</p>
      <p class="mt-5">A pedometer itself is a relatively simple concept, and on most iPhones, users already have a
        built-in health app that does just that. What I wanted to know was what additional features, interface, etc,
        gives an app the edge to attract users in.</p>

        them to apple’s health app, I conducted 6 in-depth interviews with people of varying ages (19-55) and of varying
        exercise habits (low-high) for their opinions of each app.</span></p>

        <p><span class="font-bold text-red-400">AUDIENCE |</span> Based on the users’ responses, I was able to identify 3 different users, 1 for each app. Pedometer++ attracted more of an older, less tech-savvy audience. StepsApp seemed more towards those who wanted to track a little bit more than their steps and could use a little extra motivation. Pacer was for those who were more dedicated to fitness, specifically those who looked for the most out of their apps.</p>

While it's simpleness was a positive, some users felt it didn't have enough features to draw them towards it. One of its biggest strengths were in the awards, which are clever ways of motivating its users.</p>

          I learned about the importance of colors and sizing, especially about their influence on a user’s thought process.<br><br>

          I experienced the importance of a landing page-they can determine how someone feels about the entire app<br><br>
