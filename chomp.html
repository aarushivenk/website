      Duke
      University where we were tasked with this prompt, and there we learned about content and design principles as we
      worked
      out a way to solve our common problem. Here's my own take on the bootcamp's prompt.

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">The Problem</h1>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-center text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        After a year of the pandemic, we're all tired of cooking at home. We need to find a way to provide more dining
        options
        and promote local restaurants.
      </div>
      <p>Our first step as a group was to understand what our stakeholders envisioned for this product. We came up
        with key questions to include in our interview, some of which are below:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          How do you currently go about choosing where to eat?
        </li>
        <li>
          What do you like and dislike about the food delivery apps you currently use?
        </li>
        <li>
          What information would you like to have when choosing where to order from?
        </li>
        <li>For this mobile app, how would you define success?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!--Solution-->
    <div class="space-y-4 py-6 lg:py-10">
      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Content Analysis</h1>
      <p>After going through the answers from the stakeholder interview, we compiled words and phrases that stood out to
        us and sorted them into key categories.
      </p>
      <p class="font-bold">Eating Habits</p>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        "Typically, I guess the kids tell me what they want and I go and get what they want. But, when I’m by myself,
        it’s mostly whether or not I feel like soup or like fries. So, I let my stomach decide. But, I wish I was more
        adventurous because I only go to the same places. I go to McDonald’s or Panera bread and that’s it."
      </div>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        "I have my partner, so I have to take into consideration someone else’s opinions. But, I think we probably have
        about 10 places that we rotate through take-out from."
      </div>
      <p class="font-bold">Finding Food</p>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        "There are a lot of places I want to go that I see on Instagram."
      </div>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        "If I know it, I’ll go there. If I don’t know it, I’m not searching for it."
      </div>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        "I use GrubHub because they have those bigger categories like Asian and they list the restaurants. And then I
        peruse the different restaurant menus."
      </div>
      <p class="font-bold">Success Criteria</p>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        "It turns me on to a new place because I feel like I’m pretty knowledgeable with my options of where to eat
        around here. So it would be nice - a delightful outcome - I find out about a new restaurant that I haven’t tried
        yet and it’s really good."
      </div>
      <div class="p-4 m-2 text-lg rounded-md bg-gray-100">
        " It will tell me where to eat and I will actually like the place it selects."
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--Design Process-->

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Design Process</h1>
      <img src="img/Chomp-content-cards.png" alt="Content cards" class="mx-auto">
      <p>To start our design, I sorted the features the stakeholders mentioned into categories that fit most
        appropriately. Then, I made wireframes to think about the best layouts for the app, and looked to Dribbble and
        Behance for inspiration. After that, I created some mockups and settled on a design for the app.

      <p>Sticking with the warm color palette we chose in the bootcamp, I chose the typography

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-4">Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        Participating in this bootcamp was an amazing experience. I am so thankful to
        have the experience to learn about the components of UX/UI design from talented individuals, as well as the
        opportunity to work with others interested in the same field.
        <br>

        Working on <span class="font-semibold">CHOMP</span> in particular was a really fun experience. I spent a lot of
        time browsing sites such as Behance and Dribbble for inspiration, and this certainly challenged my conceptions
        of UI design. I found that the most useful part of the process was the content analysis. Sorting information
        into cards that group together common categories was very helpful for me to organize my own information. I found
        myself going back to this list and creating new ones, understanding what the flow of information should be and
        how to make it the easiest for the user. It is definitely going to be a practice I continue in future projects.
