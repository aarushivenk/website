        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">About the Program</h2>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">Over the past year, Zoom has played an integral role in everyday communications at
          Duke and across the globe. Utilizing mobile technology and the Zoom Developer Platform, we worked with Duke
          OIT and other partners across campus to develop a web app to evolve Zoom’s presence and capabilities within
          higher education.</p>
        <p class="my-6 bg-gray-100 p-6 text-center rounded-lg md:text-lg">There are currently 40,000 licensed users at
          Duke who, during the month of April, held between 8,000 and 10,000 meetings a day.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">About the Scope</h2>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">We were tasked with developing an educational app that further enhances the
          collaborative efforts between instructors and students, as well as opening the door to new resources
          supporting education. With almost a full year of hindsight available, we can begin to fill in the gaps of
          where Zoom can be improved to meet Duke’s needs of providing a hybrid/remote teaching and learning
          experience that rivals that of an in-person offering.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">Our Stakeholders:</h2>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">For our project, we regularly communicated with our three stakeholders:</p>

            At the start of our project, our initial guidance was to create a web app that could improve the
            capabilities
            of Zoom for education. Within our team, we brainstormed potential avenues that we could explore. We also
            met
            with
            our stakeholders to evaluate what they deem to be the potential areas of improvement. </p>

              <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">
                To validate our scope and understand potential solutions, we conducted a survey of the Duke
                undergraduate
                student body and received 19 responses. Our hypotheses were that:
              </p>
              <ul class="pl-6 py-6">
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  B) Students watch course recordings to study, not just as a way to skip live sessions

                <li>
                  C) Students felt that the current way of sorting through recordings is time-consuming and difficult
                </li>
              </ul>


              <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">
                At a high-level, we saw that students were accustomed to watching recordings from their Zoom lectures
                for
                a variety of purposes, including studying and making up missed lectures.

              We also asked questions to gauge what would be better for students and how willing they would be to
              contribute to a solution.

              <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">These results were somewhat surprising! While Duke currently has tools in
                place like Piazza that
                allow
                students to collaborate and ask questions for each other and professors, we were unsure of how willing
                they would be to add their own thoughts to lecture content. This result opened up possibilities for
                our
                future functionalities as we found that students would be more likely to find the recording they are
                looking for if they have some identifying feature. </p>

        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl text-2xl font-semibold">Solution</h1>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">We thought of some “How might we” questions and collaborated with our project leads
          to brainstorm

          the Sakai LMS and
          Panopto
          which is a popular tool for managing videos, and indirect competitors like Piazza and Gong. What we saw was
          there were common elements that made posts/videos stand out:

        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">Through collaborative sessions, we decided on our question to be: <span

          Our web-app can then act
          as a crowdsourcing platform to have students, the users, to update content, add their own notes, and watch
          videos - all in the same place.</p>

        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">First, I sketched out the necessary components.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">Mockups</h2>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">After critiquing the wireframes as a group, we started generating lo-fi mockups to
          better visualize our
          app.

        </div>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">
          With more feedback, we solidified our base design and moved on to hi-fi mockups to better represent our
          designs.

        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">As we were inputting and testing data with our prototype, we found that the table
          was getting a bit long.
          We
          decided to add a second view, a card view, that’s common in similar services like Panopto or Notion. We also
          experimented with different styles to better align with Duke's style guide.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">Stakeholder Feedback</h2>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">From the faculty point of view, they’d like to see what students are doing on their
          site. For us to
          understand
          that, we had to be able to implement roles - identification of the user into either a student or faculty.
          This
          insight adapted both the infrastructure and design of our app. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">User Testing</h2>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">Using real-life data from youtube transcripts from a math class one of our team
          members took in the spring
          semester. We interviewed 11 students, asking them to give us their impressions of the app and complete a few
          tasks. Some tasks included:
        </p>
        <ul class="pl-6 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            Find the title of a lecture that occurred on a specific date.
          </li>
          <li>
            Indicate that a specific keyword is relevant to a lecture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add your own thoughts from the lecture to the recording page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">The results were surprising! Users were able to identify issues in flow (like the
          navigation not having a
          home
          button) that we were unsure of, and supported design decisions like having a list view and a card view.
          We also found that 45% of users would be more likely to edit a section called “Notes” than “Summary” because
          a
          summary is supposed to be a concise 1 or 2 sentence statement.
        </p>
        <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">Students also noted that they were unsure how to differentiate between
          autogenerated content and teacher
          approved content, which gave us more to think about. We took all the suggestions that came out of the user
          testing and ranked them according to priority (which was determined partly by how many users ran into the
          same
          problem) and feasibility (how much effort it would take to implement the feature). We then systematically
          addressed this feedback for the remaining time of our project.</p>

        <div class="pb-36">
          <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">
            As my first team project, I learned a tremendous amount from Code+. First and foremost, I learned a lot
            about
            cooperation with team members, which was an interesting challenge participating in this program through a
            hybrid
            environment (2 of our team members were on campus and the rest of us were remote). I also gained valuable
            experience pacing our workload against a deadline.
            <br><br>
            Because this was one of the first projects I’ve had to scope out myself, I saw firsthand the importance of
            prioritization. There were so many interesting and ambitious ideas that we had, especially with a
            product
            like Zoom that we’ve all become so accustomed to using, so it was definitely a challenge deciding which to
            tackle first.
            <br><br>
            Despite our program only lasting 10 weeks, I felt as though we made incredible progress and learned so
            much.
            I’m
            so thankful for the opportunity to work with my talented team, and I look forward to seeing our project
            one
            day
            impact the Duke community!
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">Next Steps</h2>
          <p class="my-6 md:text-lg">For our app, we hope to respond to stakeholder and user feedback by implementing
            multi-platform support and advanced admin features. We hope to continue doing more user testing with
            longer 75-minute class data to evaluate the accuracy of our auto generated tags and summaries. We hope to
            update our web app and beta test it in classes during the fall and spring semester to evaluate if it can
            be used as an alternative to the current solution.</p>
